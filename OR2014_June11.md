## OR 2014 - June 11, 2014 - Conference notes
9:00 am - Repository Rants

### Comprehensive digital preservation repositories: gaps, and what do we mean by “repository” anyway?

* preservation - Safe, Long Term, Trusted
* when we don't have the physical object 
* how do ensure we are preserving born-digital
	* ensure we have a preservation mandate
* what does 'forever' mean in the preservation repo
* need selection and retention policies for digital content
* preserving A/V material ... physical formats and the gear to play them are disappearing. Important to migrate that content now.

### A repository is NOT a digital archive

* repository ... defn. ... nothing assoicatied with long term
* a preservation plan it needed
* selected preservation 
* archival-quality digital objects
* preservation metadata ... does the object have it
* tech metadata with preservation in mind
* preservation is 'active'
* access and rights mgt for the long term
* regular, planned checks ... does it play.
* preservation training - London stephanie.taylor@london.ac.uk
* NDSA National Digital Stewardship Alliance in the US

* anthopologists/archivist/archaeologist
* acquire backups of content systems 
* harvesting institutional website and content
* virtual images of entire systems

### The Invisible Institutional Repository: Missing a Trick (and Missing Fulltext)? - William Nixon

### Think about sustainability

* economist, works in a bank
* NEURUS
	* faculty works, metadata, portal, meetings, 2010 launched a website portal. 2014 metadata deleted, portal deleted. 
	* 4 year life.
	* Why
		* Economists have a pre-print culture
	* How could it have been better
		* ask users
		* ask others that are doing the same
* RePEc	
	* access to researc and disseminiation
	* 1700 pub provide metadata
	* Services
	* Designed by users, no central costs, clear purpose/value, incentives

### An Alternative American Approach to Repositories

* totally mediated
* immediate feedback
* maximize content upload
* IR belongs to the faculty
* disseminate faculty content as widely as possible
* 2nd largest IR in US
* 71,000 Fulltext dl
* University's most visited sub-domain
* content appears above commercial publishers
* typeset author versions to match published works
* exploit Public Domain
* harvest and repost
* Repositorieans ... 
* this was a good rant.

### A tale of two communities

* documentation issues
* created a group to help each other ... are they contributing back to the wider OS community or have they created their own "echo chamber"?
* it is hard ... to install, maintain, write documentation for, .... 

### Raise All Ships: Cooperative Repository Strategies in a Boot-Strap Culture

* differences in large institutions and small institutions
* Texas Digital Library

## Hacking User Experience in a Repository Service: ScholarSphere as a Case Study

* PennState
* UX
	* build simplicity into your repository
	* about services as well
* 9 months to bring ScholarSphere online
	* Liaison librarians
	* LL provided use cases
	* Lots of listening
	* Devs at meeting ... crucial
* Marketing ... we should talk to Dave A. or IC about doing a campaign
* IslandScholar's profile page ... what else to include? 
	* Do faculty have a twitter account ? or other social media accounts that they want to share? would we embed a twitter feed? 
	*  ResearchGate, ORCID, Mendeley, ScholarID, ...  

## Spotlight: A Blacklight Plugin for Showcasing Digital Collections

* sits on top of repo
* digital library discovery environments
* full featured, flexible, self-service, integrated
* Maps of Africa: An Online Exhibit
	* list, grid, slideshow, geo coordinates
	* curator has added customization
	* deep zoom viewer - openseadragon
	* browse feature ... created by curator ... canned searches for users
* A spotlight exhibit
	* index of empty items (a defined collection/set of objects)
	* settings - drupal site admin eg. title of site
	* create custom pages, home, feature, ... 
	* wysiwyg ... widgets
	* simple text formating tools
	* repo tools ... widgets that integrate with repo objects. eg insert tn, image grids
	* curator has control over display and facets ... labels, display order of metadata, etc.
	* exhibit specific fields
		* eg. curartor's note field 

----
* skylight solution
	* mediated by devs
	* php
* skylightII
	* bootstrap
	* handlebars for templates
	* data providers - NodeJS and PHP
	
## Afternoon sessions

### The Human Communication Science Virtual Lab (HCS vLab): A repository microclimate in a rapidly evolving research-ecosystem

**Peter Sefton**
* Research data focus
* "License Tool Manager" - researcher agrees to set of license provisions
* Hydra objects communicated as events/items
* API - PS sees this as the method that researchers will interact with their data. Not a gui.
	* eg. researchers get an endpoint that they can copy/paste to pull the data, visualization, etc.
	* researchers request an API Key that limits them to their datasets
* Blacklight and Sesame provide search interfaces
* Software module that handles ingest (RoboChef) 
* Data > preview
	* item list and item list actions
	* provide researchers with methods/tools to run on the list of items
	* typically python and R
* Galaxy workflow system
	* really nice gui for creating workflows
	* hope to integrate / expose to researchers

### Data and APIs Everywhere
UQueensland

* Fez install ... bespoke code ... in github
* APIs for Scopus, WoS
* Dedupping is an issue ... they have a method ... compare titles, dois, journal names, issns etc.
* visualizations of data using Angular JS and D3
* Lavaevel ? PHP Library

### Microservices

Donald / Paul

### MLTDL - More Like This for Digital Libraries

* a recommender system
* uses apache solr
* privacy concerns 
	* user's IP currently (would be difficult to determine specific user)
	* move to logins and opt in / opt out provisions
* seems to have a good algorithym for recommendations
