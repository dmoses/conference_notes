Changing culture

* "cost of knowledge" boycott
* refusing to edit for a paywalled journal

## 24x7 talks

### Making SHERPA/FACT Local

* [http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/fact](http://) 
* FACT is the SHERPA tool that tells authors if a given journal complies with certain funders’ requirements for open access, whether via the gold or green route.
* Display green only. 
	* provide a sample subject list with compliance
	
### Too many copies: confusion between duplication and versioning

* Pubication Router diagram (also her poster)
* Duplication is a good thing (eg. replicating to other repos for example, LOCKSS)
* Author > Publisher > Versions (draft, etc. NISO defines several versions) 
* Author > Subject Repo and/or IR
* Author(s) > Subject Repo and/or IR
* Journal Router helps with provenance type metadata

### Preserve your content with LOCKSS-O-Matic

* LOCKSS 
	* Can create Private Lockss networks (PLN) that replicates and harvests contents
	* share a common set of config files
* Problems
	* config files for nodes are manually maintained
* Solutions
	* automate network config files
	* automate ingest of new content into network 
* LOCKSS-O-MATIC
	* LAMP app
		* UI
		* SWORD
		* network monitoring tools
	* Supports automated or manual ingest
	* diagram of l-o-m framework
	* Deposit
		* CSV of base URL for content to be harvested
	* Use Cases
		* Archivematica integration
			* Utilizing SWORD
		* PKP PLN
			* OJS journals SWORD deposit
		* Islanodora integration
	* Work remaining
		* UI, net monitoring, test/documentation, release 2014
		
### Invenio v2.0: A Pythonic Framework for Large-Scale Digital Libraries

* v2 of Invenio
* DL depository software
* IR use cases, subject repo use case, Document server
* custom to generalized solution
* XML API to JSON API
* moved to Github
* Flask ? extensions 
* Support for EAD > JSON translation
* Linked data concepts
* using Bagit 
* Blog Forever ... 

### SobekCM’s Community Ecosystems & Socio-Technical Practices

* pair-tree
* support for many XML formats
* Windows Server application
* dLOC - digital library of the caribbean
	* digitization toolkits
* Q/A tools ... 
* Curator tools ... 

### EPrints Imports via DOI and ORCID
* the ability to extract ORCID IDs from the data contained in a DOI import and the ability to discover and import new works using the ORCID Identifier via ORCID API. 
* BORIS 
* Import via DOI standard plugin for EPrints
* ORCID ID gets returned as part of the import
	* lookup buttons result that allow user to add more authors
* ORCID Admin interface in EPrints
	* interface to confirm or associate people in the repo with their orcid ids
* ORCID Public API
	* works metadata
	* data gets extracted (eg. a DOI or PMID)and can be reused to launch another harvest etc.
* To update member profiles ... you need to access the Member API ... which requires auth, etc.
* the ORCID API is well documented.

### Evolver: The Evolution of The Extended EPrints Ecosystem

* focus on getting info in
* Isolation to collaborative projects
* text to mutlimedia
* galleries/exhibit tools ... eg. herbarium project Linnean Society
* Atlantic Archive - Uk/US proj ... wartime correspondence/book like material
* creating journals from repo content
	* SAS Open Journals

### Rising to the impossible challenge: the storage of all research data, forever?

* "The task of storing research data objects, potentially for many decades, both safely and securely, at the lowest possible cost, and whilst still ensuring the data can be easily retrieved (bit-perfect) when required is far from straightforward."
* focus on 'deep storage' archive layer (eg. tape)
* cloud based services for archival storage
	* data and financial escrow
	* tax
	* bandwidth
* tape model 180 Euro/TB over 5 yrs
* Data Archive Cloud Model
	* unknown volume
	* ISO security standards
	* ... 
* Data Archive as Service ...
