## GIS Workshop - June 9 - Morning

### Fieldtrip GB

* [http://fieldtripgb.blogs.edina.ac.uk/](http://) 
* works without GPS
* doesn't rely on grid
* potentially something to look at for fieldwork ... recording specimen data, etc.

### Hands-on using qgis and data sets.

* see handout
* created map using raster (image), vector(points), and wms(map base) layers ... historical buildings in Edinburgh.
* QGIS Plugins
     * OGR ... create a exported version of the work you did to put on the web as an interactive map.

### GIS in Digital Repositories

* [slides](https://docs.google.com/a/upei.ca/file/d/0B5fLh2mc4FCbMFFPQjJtX1hidW8/edit)
* metadata and wrangling > curation > delivery > discovery
* Hydra ... community and tech framework ... repo with many diff heads
	* hydra head (CRUD), Blacklight (Read), Fedora, Solr (Solrizer) ... could we use solrizer in Islandora and get rid of GSearch?
* vector data - point, line, polygon - GeoBlackLight
* historic maps can be georectified ... transparency allows you to view basemap
* raster data - modelled output ..eg population data, can also be imagery ... 
* GIS Data
	* layers of data (eg. vector and rastor)
	* those and other assets with geo properties ... eg. a postcard with coordinate data
* Discovery
	* see slide 20 for screencast link, etc.
	* see discovery use cases in slides 22 and 23 
	* GeoBlacklight demo ... really nice
	* MODS metadata ... extension element with custom schema to record bounding box data ... maybe ESRI?
	* Geoportal
		* http://geodata.tufts.edu - is another way to  discover GIS data
	* BlackLight Maps
		* tool to map results that have coordinate info
		* clustering 
		* alternative views
		* eg. scanned maps that have a bounding box ... but have not been georectified
	* Bassi-Veratti Collection
		* custom application for manuscripts with geo data ... eg letters tagged with Florence.
		* spatial view of the content
		
### GeoServer

* important part of GIS infrastructure
* plug in various database servers ... output various servers
* GDAL ... important as well ... conversion utility ... many file formats supported
* GeoTIFF and Shapefiles as canoncial formats at Stanford
