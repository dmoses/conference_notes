## Fedora 4 Update

David Wilcox

* interest in folks doing beta pilots
* user testing
* all use cases and features posted.
* developer commitments
	* commitments are needed
	* for UPEI ... can we plan something a few months out ? 

Chris Beer

* Spotlight
	* a tool to create exhibits 
	* annotations in exhibits pushed into Fedora4
	* MODS xml to MODS RDF using LoC transform
	* WC3 provo schema
	* pulling data back out - [Marmotta](http://wiki.apache.org/marmotta/DeveloperIntroduction) from Apache foundation using ldpath [http://wiki.apache.org/marmotta/LDPath](http://wiki.apache.org/marmotta/LDPath) ... tool to flatten linked data resources for solr, elastic search etc

* F4 Features
	* content modeling
	* authorization
		* rules on resources or any parent on the resource
	* durable storage
		* fixity checks (on demand request), policy driven storage (based on characteristics of content loaded), backup and restore (full repo), import/export of single resource or tree of resources, projection/federation
		* write a connector to back end store ... openstack / swift ?
	* versioning
		* 
	* Scale
	* Linked data / RDF (and external triplestore)
	* Internal and external search
		* eg. text search of properties of objects, basic SPARQL query
		* external index to allow user searching
		* JMS messages coming out of repo
			* service consumes messages and take rep of resources and publishes them to external solr indexes or RDF stores using standard SPARL Updates.
	* transactions
		* updates, deletes, additions ... option to rollback ... or commit that transaction
	* locking
		* can lock resource when user editing eg.
	* performance
	* clustering
		* many use cases
		* most opportunity for further improvement
		* high availability (synced in a cluster)
* content modeling
	* still have a notion of objects and datastreams
	* define object
		* properties and
		* children objects
		* eg. collection, with a book child object, which has page child objects
	* define datastream properties
	* properties have types (integers, strings, ... ) 
	* relationships (F3) vs repository structure (F4)
		* F4 is best leveraged with a hierarchical structure
* RDF / Linked Data
	* complies with Linked Data Platform 1.0 recommendations
		* Drupal has this https://drupal.org/project/ldp
		* of interest might be the Open Semantic Framework for drupal 
			* https://drupal.org/project/osf 
			* http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org/index.php/Category:OSF_for_Drupal_User_Manual
	* Resource descriptions modeled as triples
	* native and external SPARQL-Query
* Ease of installation
	* simple web app (war file) 
	* One-click-run
		* Only dependency: Java7
* Scale
	* 1 TB file via REST
	* 16 million obj via projection
	* 5 million obj via REST
	* Range requests 
	* performance graphs follow
* F4 Roadmap
	* beta pilots
	* release F4 prod
	* Support migration from 3>4
	* Features for 4.1

other notes

* MODS RDF - http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/modsrdf-primer.html  
* IIIF Image
* There already is a framework for doing transforms in F4
