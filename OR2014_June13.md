# OR2014 - Friday June 13, 2014 - Interest Groups Day

## Fedora 4 Update

David Wilcox

* interest in folks doing beta pilots
* user testing
* all use cases and features posted.
* developer commitments
	* commitments are needed
	* for UPEI ... can we plan something a few months out ? 

Chris Beer

* Spotlight
	* a tool to create exhibits 
	* annotations in exhibits pushed into Fedora4
	* MODS xml to MODS RDF using LoC transform
	* WC3 provo schema
	* pulling data back out - [Marmotta](http://wiki.apache.org/marmotta/DeveloperIntroduction) from Apache foundation using ldpath [http://wiki.apache.org/marmotta/LDPath](http://wiki.apache.org/marmotta/LDPath) ... tool to flatten linked data resources for solr, elastic search etc
	
Andrew Woods

* F4 Features
	* content modeling
	* authorization
		* rules on resources or any parent on the resource
	* durable storage
		* fixity checks (on demand request), policy driven storage (based on characteristics of content loaded), backup and restore (full repo), import/export of single resource or tree of resources, projection/federation
		* write a connector to back end store ... openstack / swift ?
	* versioning
		* 
	* Scale
	* Linked data / RDF (and external triplestore)
	* Internal and external search
		* eg. text search of properties of objects, basic SPARQL query
		* external index to allow user searching
		* JMS messages coming out of repo
			* service consumes messages and take rep of resources and publishes them to external solr indexes or RDF stores using standard SPARL Updates.
	* transactions
		* updates, deletes, additions ... option to rollback ... or commit that transaction
	* locking
		* can lock resource when user editing eg.
	* performance
	* clustering
		* many use cases
		* most opportunity for further improvement
		* high availability (synced in a cluster)
* content modeling
	* still have a notion of objects and datastreams
	* define object
		* properties and
		* children objects
		* eg. collection, with a book child object, which has page child objects
	* define datastream properties
	* properties have types (integers, strings, ... ) 
	* relationships (F3) vs repository structure (F4)
		* F4 is best leveraged with a hierarchical structure
* RDF / Linked Data
	* complies with Linked Data Platform 1.0 recommendations
		* Drupal has this https://drupal.org/project/ldp
		* of interest might be the Open Semantic Framework for drupal 
			* https://drupal.org/project/osf 
			* http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org/index.php/Category:OSF_for_Drupal_User_Manual
	* Resource descriptions modeled as triples
	* native and external SPARQL-Query
* Ease of installation
	* simple web app (war file) 
	* One-click-run
		* Only dependency: Java7
* Scale
	* 1 TB file via REST
	* 16 million obj via projection
	* 5 million obj via REST
	* Range requests 
	* performance graphs follow
* F4 Roadmap
	* beta pilots
	* release F4 prod
	* Support migration from 3>4
	* Features for 4.1

other notes

* MODS RDF - http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/modsrdf-primer.html  
* IIIF Image
* There already is a framework for doing transforms in F4


### Hydra
* working on solution bundles
	* eg. Avalon for audio / video

	* one developer (volunteer)	
* Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum
	* one developer

	* one developer

### Hydramata
* IR ... cross-institutional development effort
* Shared needs
* Mixed Architecture (any format can be assigned to a work type)
	* shared services
* Emerging goals
	* IR part of the larger instutitional framework   
	* generalizing components ... that institutions would then customize
* Hydramata
	* a set of separate hydra-based automata ... 
* Transformation
* Problems to be addressed
	* hard to understand, maintain, configure
	* ingest unreliable and opaque
	* not setup for advanced work
	* decreasing velocity, increasing errors, diminishing ROI, preservation failure
* decouple the system
	* different viewers, 
	* implement an ayschronous transaction
* design approach
* components
	* IIF
	* TEI support
	* specialized views
	* ORCID plugin
	* Minting DOIs
	* Syndication 
	* Exhibits (Spotlight)
	* ...    			
* Single asynchronous transactions
	* they are building a workflow / monitoring ingest workflow
	* modelling based on OAIS - sip, aip, dip
* Rebuilding core
	* role-based access control
	* multistage workflows
* outcomes
	* easier to understand, maintain, configure
	* ingest process built ... 
* Fedora4
	* Fedora Virtual Workspace ?
	* notion of transactions ... potentially sequence a whole workflow across ... 
* Swappable Hydramata
	*  	  
* Plugging In and Out
	* DIP mapper 

## Afternoon sessions

* Goals: explore and test Fedora4 with real data
* Local Broadcast News Media
	* WSLS TV News Collection
	* 13K 16mm of clips
	* 18K anchor scripts
	* NEH grant - 2007
	* Live with F3 version
* grasp of changes that came with F4
* PIDs missing and handle is there
	* PID is the URI to the path to the object
	* potentially use apache mod_rewrite ... 
* F3 and F4 relationships
	* relationship is visible in the path
	* hierarchy has special uses 
* RDF replaces XML
