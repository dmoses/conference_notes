## Breaking down the boundaries to storing, sharing and publishing research data 

Monash U

* Service
	* [http://store.synchrotron.org.au](http://store.synchrotron.org.au)
	* built on MyTardis (a data mgt platform - OS ... built in AU)
* [Nectar](http://nectar.org.au) (computing in the cloud)
* Why
	* meet the challenge of diffraction data deposition
	* provide model of other synch.
	* reproducable results
* research data curation continuum
	* private, shared, public domains
* metadata
	* ex sources to derive metdaata
		* instrument md
	* on pub
	* lib enhances md
	* DOI ? assigned
*  Challenges
	* researcher engagement
		* publish your research, then publish your raw data with us. a screensaver that promotes the service on the equipment PC.
	* understanding research needs and domains
	* keeping up with changing requirements
	* making a project into a well supported service
	* currently have a complicated workflow to get data released
	* ongoing cost of keeping data available, maintaining DOIs
		* not all Monash users
* Discovery
	* pushing metadata to other discovery services
* Going forward
	* multi modal data
	* automating workflows
	* incorp connections

### Building a Research Data Registry for the UK
DCC

The UK Research Data (Metadata) Registry (UKRDR) Pilot Project, funded by Jisc, is implementing a prototype registry for the research data assets created by UK researchers. 

* using software from Research Data Australia
* 6month pilot registry
	* short timeframe
	* ANDS had suitable software - ORCA - and tested with JISC
	* SEO optimized
	* Data as first class scholarly output
	* cite-able
	
* Metadata standard
	* RIF-CS metadata standard ... supported in AU
	* metadata records crosswalked to RIF-CS
	* harvest metadata
	* reports on the project
	* [http://www.dcc.ac.uk/projects/research-data-registry-pilot](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/projects/research-data-registry-pilot)
	* [http://rdrds.cloudapp.net](http://rdrds.cloudapp.net)
* Collaborators
	* Data Centres, Universities
* Crosswalks (RIF-CS)
	* DataCite 3 
	* DDI Codebook 2.5
	* EPrints 3
	* MODS 3.5
	* OAI-PMH DC
	* UK Gemini 2.2   
	 
## From library repository to university-wide service: Stanford Digital Repository as a case study
Hannah Frost

* [SDR](http://library.stanford.edu/sdr) http://library.stanford.edu/sdr
* research and teaching repo
* 530K objects
* IR content is 3300 ETDs,1300 ojbects from Stanford depositors
* Courses are using the repo
* Onlline deposit system
* Focus on RD and student works
* favor timely deposit with low barrier tools
* Mindful of TDR ... 
* ARL "Research Library's Role in Digital Repository Services"
	* Access, Content, Context
	* SDR
		* Lots of content ... diverse
		* Low barrier metadata requirements ... staff mediation
		* access major focus
* Thinking like a business
	* competition/complementary
		* Figshare, Dryad, ICPSR, etc.
	* policy and legal issues
		* deposit agreement framework
	* financing and cost modeling
		* "Under Construction"	  
* Marketing and Communications
	* Depositor's values
		* save time, library services? may have never used a library service, institiional affiliation? young researchers may move on so less important
	* Pay attention to language
		* Long-term preservation > Persistent access.
* Highlighting the benefits
	* the focus is on the depositors
	* testimonial from users
		* quick links to highlight deposit
* Marketing tech
	* blog posts, newsletters, ads, faculty meetings, events on key issues, "deposit parties", focus on grad students and young faculty, build on previous success.

* Supporting the service
	* SDR service team (librarians and staff)
		* power users and local experts ... work with faculty and assist librarian colleagues
		* dev user documentation eg. Selecting Research and Other Works for Deposit to the SDR
		* leverage existing relationships, skill dev, cross-poll. ideas, SDR as library wide service
* Recognize preservation challenges
	* more diverse content
		* File formats ... embedding file characterization processes
		* File sizes ... esp media
		* challenges readiness to TDR
* How Hydra helps
	* building services incrementally
	* strong growing sharing community
